Introduction and Context
One day in the year of the rat, a nice man named Dan approached us with one goal: to expand his bagel enterprise. Dan wanted some way
that he and his customers could access his beloved bagel shop online. Dan wanted Dan's Bagels to go all over the world. This is why he
contacted the best group of programmers to do this. This is why he contacted HighFive. That is exactly what we will do.
