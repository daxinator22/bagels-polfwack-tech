Explanation of the organization and name scheme:
* Variable names are in camelCase.

Version-control procedures:
* We are using git to keep track of the different versions.

Tool stack description and set up procedure:
* We plan on using Python, and the Django plug in to complete the project.
* Because we are using Django, you should just be able to visit a specific url (which will be determined in the future) to be able to see the process.

Build instructions: 
* We are building the program in Django.

Unit testing instructions: 
* We expect all the code to be unit tested piece by piece.
