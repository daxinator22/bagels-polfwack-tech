Explanation of the organization and name scheme:
* Variable names are in camelCase.
* Plan to use Object Oriented programming with classes to be used in multiple situations as needed.

Version-control procedures:
* We are using git to keep track of the different versions.

Tool stack description and set up procedure:
* We plan on using Python, and the Django plug in to complete the project.
* Because we are using Django, you should just be able to visit a specific url (which will be determined in the future) to be able to see the process.

Build instructions: 
* Building the current state of the Django Project:
	1. cd into the directory highFiveBagels/src/highFive
	2. run the command "python manage.py runserver"
	3. On your web browser search bar, enter "http://127.0.0.1:8000/home

Unit testing instructions: 
* We expect all the code to be unit tested piece by piece.

System testing instructions: 
* The whole system should be ready to be tested before the 2nd week of December.
